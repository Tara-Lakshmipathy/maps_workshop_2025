    "The following are some important features for using the widget. Some more known bugs are listed after the guide.\n",
    "### Node library:\n",
    "* Click on an item with a green icon in the node library to display nodes within a file in the `pyiron_nodes` folder.\n",
    "* Click on a node (red icon) to make it appear in the workflow area of the widget.\n",
    "### Basic features:\n",
    "* Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.\n",
    "* Hold left-click and move the mouse to pan.\n",
    "* Right-click will open the jupyter drop down menu for the cell and currrently has no functionality in the app.\n",
    "* Click on a node and press \"Run\" to execute the node and all upstream nodes that connect to it.\n",
    "* Left-click on a node, hold and move the mouse to move a node around.\n",
    "* Click on a node and press \"Source\" to view the source code of the function behind the node.\n",
    "* Change values in the editable fields and press \"Run\" to see updated results.\n",
    "* Click on an output port of a node and drag the line to a valid input port of another node to form a data-flow channel.</br>\n",
    "  If an input port of a node has both an incoming data channel and an editable field input, the data channel will be given priority.\n",
    "* Select a node or an edge by clicking on it, and then press \"backspace\" on the keyboard to delete.\n",
    "### More features:\n",
    "* Click on \"Reset Layout\" in the bottom-right of the workflow area to automatically rearrange nodes.\n",
    "* Click on \"Run Workflow\" in the top-right of the workflow area to run all nodes in the workflow area.\n",
    "* Hold shift+left-click and drag around nodes and edges to select them. Then click on \"Create Macro\" (top-right) to create a node with a sub-workflow (a macro).</br>\n",
    "  The created macro will appear in the node library in a green box with the name assigned to it (default: custom_macro).</br>\n",
    "  Click on it to make it appear in the workflow area.\n",
    "* \"Save workflow\" and \"Delete Save file\" or only valid for the current session of the binder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node status:\n",
    "* The square box next to the name of the node indicates the execution status of the node:</br>\n",
    "  White is for nodes not yet executed</br>\n",
    "  Green is for nodes that have been successfully executed</br>\n",
    "  Red is for failed nodes\n",

    "## Known bugs\n",
    "* Nodes and edges can sometimes disappear. Open a different file in the notebook (by clicking on the folder icon on the top-left) and then reopen this file to make the nodes/edges reappear.\n",
    "* Sometimes, clicking on an output port to start forming a data channel will not cause a line to appear. The solution to this is the same as the previous issue.\n",
    "* It may be needed to click on nodes, edges and node-library items twice to activate them.\n",
